how 2 commit tax fraud

step 1: avoid tax

step 4: done
school project haha

So funny story, after allegedlly hosting a game site (cough cough asquidboi.github.io) My entire domain for GithubPages is, you guessed it, b l o c k e d

i have 3 options:

1. Buy a domain
   
2. Figure out how the hell to use Jekyll

3. Make a new github account

I would say that #4 is use google sites like a normal person but that's completely out of the question, i am banned from Google due to the extensive list of war crimes i did NOT commit

edit: the github wizard has blessed me with a solution, just domains thank you @penguinencounter
